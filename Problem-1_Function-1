\section{Introduction}

Arcos(x)  generally define as the inverse of the trigonometric Cosine function. The arc- prefix depicts the inverse part of the function. In general all the trigonometric  functions when measured in radians is of$\Theta$  radian.However the inverse function lies under the radian of $(r\Theta)$ . Cosine Function in general is the function for finding the value at an angle $\Theta$. Whereas the Inverse function is used to find the value  of an unknown length of right angle.

\section{Characteristics of Arcos(x):}
Originally the arcos function was simply written with the susbscipt '-1' but that was confused with the exponent. So to avoid this confusion arcos prefix was used and function was defined as followed: 
\center If x=cos y
 
\begin{flushleft} 
 Then the inverse function is written as :
 \end{flushleft}
                \center y= cos $x^{-1}$  
  \begin{flushleft}  
  Which can also be written as : arccos x = cos $x^{-1}  = y$. 
  \linebreak 
   \end{flushleft}
  \section{Domain and Range Of Inverse Function:}
  The domain of the function is restricted to [-1,1]. Due to the mapping in case of Arccos function being many-to-one inverse function would not  satisfy any one range. Where as the arccos function defines in the range of 0 to $\pi$. \\
