Debugging a way of detecting errors in your code. We can check the correctness of the codes variable by variable. For our project we have used the Debugger from Eclise IDE. \\

Advantages of using Debugger:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using the print statements for checking the correctness was one of the methods that could have been used but for that we have to our code but using debugger makes the work more easier to check the code.
    \item It made easier to check the code because of the familiarity of the IDE with the knowledge.
    \item The debugger connects with the libraries used. 
    \item Using this debugger makes it easier for the programmer because they can simply edit the code, recompile it and update everything in same window instead of getting into the hassle of copying code and then making changes.\\
    
    Disadvantages of Using IDE compilers:
    \item Can't rely on debugger for bugs because of no real time running.
    \item Doesn't really works well with the multiple screens.
    
\end{itemize}
